abstract: Smart surveillance cameras are increasingly employed for automated tasks such as event and anomaly detection within smart city infrastructures. However, the heterogeneity of deployment environments, ranging from densely populated urban intersections to quiet residential neighborhoods, renders the use of a single, universal model suboptimal. To address this, we propose the construction of a model zoo comprising models trained for diverse environmental contexts. We introduce an automated transferability assessment framework that identifies the most suitable model for a new deployment site. This task is particularly challenging in smart surveillance settings, where both source data and labeled target data are typically unavailable. Existing approaches often depend on pretrained embeddings or assumptions about model uncertainty, which may not hold reliably in real-world scenarios. In contrast, our method leverages embeddings generated by randomly initialized neural networks (RINNs) to construct task-agnostic reference embeddings without relying on pretraining. By comparing feature representations of the target data extracted using both pretrained models and RINNs, this method eliminates the need for labeled data. Structural similarity between embeddings is quantified using minibatch-Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), enabling efficient and scalable model ranking. We evaluate our method on realistic surveillance datasets across multiple downstream tasks, including object tagging, anomaly detection, and event classification. Our embedding-level score achieves high correlations with ground-truth model rankings (relative to fine-tuned baselines), attaining Kendall‚Äôs ùúè values of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.89 on these tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that our framework consistently selects the most transferable model, even when the specific downstream task or objective is unknown. This confirms the practicality of our approach as a robust, low-cost precursor to model adaptation or retraining.
